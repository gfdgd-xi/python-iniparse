python-iniparse (0.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  From [1]:
  * Square bracket syntax will auto-add missing attributes now.  Earlier
  it used to raise a KeyError exception.  If you were relying on the
  exception to check whether an attribute was defined, you need to
  change your code to use the 'in' operator.
